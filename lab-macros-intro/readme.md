# Lab | Macros intro

### Instructions

- You are working as an analyst for an e-commerce platform. Your team receives data from a server about the activities of visitors on the website. The data is received at an interval of 12 hours from the servers and is recorded in the excel file in different sheets. Data recorded over 2 days is given to you in the file `files_for_lab/server_data.xlsm`.

- The data downloaded from the servers is not in the desired format. We want to format the data and make it more presentable for your manager. Since the data is in different sheets, it would make more sense to create a macro. This is how the final data would look like: [link to the image - Expected Output](https://education-team-2020.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/data-analytics/6.7-lab-expected_output.png)
<!--   Note that the data is sorted by the column `client_id` from the smallest to the largest values. -->

- Record a macro and apply it on all the sheets. Be careful if you have to use relative references or absolute reference in this case.
- Go through the visual basic editor and remove the lines from the code that are not manipulating the data.
